    <h1>Study Guide: Wavelength and Energy of Electrons</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction to Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
        <p>Imagine standing on a beach, watching waves crash onto the shore. Electromagnetic radiation works in a similar way—except instead of water waves, we're dealing with waves of energy. These waves help us understand everything from how your phone connects to Wi-Fi to the light emitted by stars. In this section, we'll dive into what electromagnetic waves are, how they interact with electrons, and why they matter in the world of chemistry.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electromagnetic Spectrum</strong>: Understand the range of electromagnetic waves, from radio waves to gamma rays.</li>
            <li><strong>Wavelength (λ)</strong>: The distance between two consecutive peaks in a wave. Measured in meters (m).</li>
            <li><strong>Frequency (ν)</strong>: The number of waves that pass a given point per second. Measured in hertz (Hz).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="equations">
        <h2>Key Equations</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Speed of Light Equation:</strong><br>
           <em>c = λ × ν</em><br>
           Where <em>c</em> is the speed of light (3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s), <em>λ</em> is the wavelength, and <em>ν</em> is the frequency.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Energy of a Photon:</strong><br>
           <em>E = h × ν</em><br>
           Where <em>E</em> is energy (Joules, J), <em>h</em> is Planck's constant (6.63 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J·s), and <em>ν</em> is the frequency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Relationship Between Wavelength, Frequency, and Energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inverse Relationship</strong>: Wavelength and frequency are inversely related. As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy and Frequency</strong>: Energy is directly proportional to frequency. Higher frequency means higher energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Calculating Wavelength and Energy</h2>
        <p>Use the speed of light equation to solve for wavelength or frequency if one is known. Use the energy equation to determine the energy of an electron based on the frequency of light it absorbs or emits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problems">
        <h2>Electron Transitions in Atoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Energy Levels</strong>: Electrons occupy specific energy levels in an atom. When electrons move between levels, they absorb or release energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Emission Spectrum</strong>: When electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit light at specific wavelengths, creating an emission spectrum unique to each element.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantization</strong>: Electrons can only exist in specific energy states, and the energy absorbed or emitted corresponds to the difference between these states.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculating Wavelength</strong>: If the frequency of light is 5.00 × 10<sup>14</sup> Hz, what is the wavelength?</li>
            <li><strong>Finding Energy</strong>: What is the energy of a photon with a frequency of 6.00 × 10<sup>14</sup> Hz?</li>
            <li><strong>Electron Transition</strong>: An electron drops from the n=3 to the n=2 energy level, emitting a photon. Describe how to calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always keep track of units. Wavelength is often given in nanometers (nm), so converting to meters might be necessary.</li>
            <li>Remember that energy and frequency are directly proportional, while wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.</li>
            <li>Use the correct value for Planck's constant and the speed of light in your calculations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Key Terms to Remember</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photon</strong>: A particle of light that carries energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantized Energy Levels</strong>: The specific energies that electrons in an atom can have.</li>
            <li><strong>Emission and Absorption</strong>: Emission involves releasing energy, while absorption involves taking in energy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Understanding the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and energy is crucial in studying the behavior of electrons. Electrons absorb or emit photons when transitioning between energy levels, and the energy of these photons can be calculated using the equations provided.</p>
